# illusion-bot
### very much a work in progress, not much is complete yet
illusion is a discord bot that (when complete) will contain all the standard moderation features of a discord bot but will also have the additional functionality of integrating with among us to mute and unmute players during gameplay.

## Usage
The bot is meant to be run on the local machine where it will be running among us, and currently does not support multiple servers at once (will be implemented later).
